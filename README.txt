Interface TSHOOTER

These scripts can be used to quickly obtain information from a Cisco switch interface while
troubleshooting endpoint connectivity issues.

To run the script you will need either the last four of the endpoints MAC-Address or the 
psyical interface it's connected on.

You can create an executable file that will run on any computer. I sent this to our helpdesk
as they don't always have a python environment setup to run these scripts. For help with
creating an .exe file from .py see the links below.
